#### sync.waitgroup的使用

```go

type WaitGroup struct {
	noCopy noCopy

	// 64-bit value: high 32 bits are counter, low 32 bits are waiter count.
	// 64-bit atomic operations require 64-bit alignment, but 32-bit
	// compilers do not ensure it. So we allocate 12 bytes and then use
	// the aligned 8 bytes in them as state, and the other 4 as storage
	// for the sema.
	state1 [3]uint32
}

func (wg *WaitGroup) Add(delta int) {
	statep, semap := wg.state()
	if race.Enabled {
		_ = *statep // trigger nil deref early
		if delta < 0 {
			// Synchronize decrements with Wait.
			race.ReleaseMerge(unsafe.Pointer(wg))
		}
		race.Disable()
		defer race.Enable()
	}
	state := atomic.AddUint64(statep, uint64(delta)<<32)
	v := int32(state >> 32)
	w := uint32(state)
	if race.Enabled && delta > 0 && v == int32(delta) {
		// The first increment must be synchronized with Wait.
		// Need to model this as a read, because there can be
		// several concurrent wg.counter transitions from 0.
		race.Read(unsafe.Pointer(semap))
	}
	if v < 0 {
		panic("sync: negative WaitGroup counter")
	}
	if w != 0 && delta > 0 && v == int32(delta) {
		panic("sync: WaitGroup misuse: Add called concurrently with Wait")
	}
	if v > 0 || w == 0 {
		return
	}
	// This goroutine has set counter to 0 when waiters > 0.
	// Now there can't be concurrent mutations of state:
	// - Adds must not happen concurrently with Wait,
	// - Wait does not increment waiters if it sees counter == 0.
	// Still do a cheap sanity check to detect WaitGroup misuse.
	if *statep != state {

	*statep = 0

		// Increment waiters count.
		if atomic.CompareAndSwapUint64(statep, state, state+1) {
			if race.Enabled && w == 0 {
				// Wait must be synchronized with the first Add.
				// Need to model this is as a write to race with the read in Add.
				// As a consequence, can do the write only for the first waiter,
				// otherwise concurrent Waits will race with each other.
				race.Write(unsafe.Pointer(semap))
